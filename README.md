<br>

## Features

A summary of the main features of the game is shown below.

<br>
<details>
  <summary><b>Existing Features</b></summary>

<br>
<details>
  <summary> <i>Banner Art</i></summary>
<br>

The user is provided with a visually interesting 'start screen' including ASCII banner art and tag lines giving context to the game.

The ASCII art was generated by [patorjk.com](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20)

<br>

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Input Validation</i></summary>
<br>

Input validation is used throughout the game wherever the user is asked to interact with the program.
These inputs will be checked, and whenever they are invalid, an alert will be displayed emphasising what the requirements are.

<br>

![Input Validation](assets/documentation/feature_02_input_validation.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Difficulty Levels</i></summary>
<br>

The user is able to select from different difficulty levels to play the game. 

Each difficulty level will initialise the game with different starting variables (e.g number of torpedos, enemy ships etc)

<br>

![Difficulty Levels](assets/documentation/feature_03_difficulty_levels.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Narrative</i></summary>
<br>

A narrative has been created for the game, depicting a scenario where the user is in command of the last battleship in a war that is doomed to be lost unless the user can protect several merchant ships that are rushing to deliver cargo that will turn the tide of events.
<br>
<br>
The narrative also subtly introduces the game mechanics to the user, and attempts to provide immersion for the user, which in turn will provide a more enjoyable user experience.
<br><br>
It should be noted, that although the narrative is completely fictional and cursory in nature, it tries to pack a punch in the few lines available. As it depicts scenarios of warfare, it may not be suitable for all audiences. As such. the game is aimed at adults instead of a younger audience.
<br><br>

![Narrative](assets/documentation/feature_04_narrative.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>SITREP Display</i></summary>
<br>

The SITREP display, or 'situation report', is the main source of information displayed to the user during the game. An overview of the different fields is shown below.
<br><br>
<b>Torpedos remaining</b>: The current number of torpedos available to the user, if this is less than the enemy ships remaining, the game mission will fail.
<br><br>
<b>Hull plates remaining</b>: The current number of hull plates on the user's battleship, this is decremented with each enemy hit. If it reaches zero, the mission will fail.
<br><br>
<b>Enemy ships remaining</b>: The current number of enemy ships afloat. This is decremented with each successful user hit. If it reaches zero, the mission will succeed.
<br><br>
<b>Merchant ships remaining</b>: The current number of merchant ships afloat. This is decremented with each accidental user hit, and successful enemy hit. If it reaches zero, the mission will fail.
<br><br>
<b>Missed shots</b>: The current number of shots missed by the user.
<br><br>
<b>Shot accuracy</b>: This is a current statistic of the user's accuracy (enemy ships destroyed / total user shots, expressed as a percentage).
<br><br>
<b>Enemy ships destroyed</b>: The current number of enemy ships destroyed by the user.
<br><br>
<b>Merchant ships destroyed</b>: The current number of merchant ships destroyed, by both the user and the enemy (computer).
<br><br>

![SITREP Display](assets/documentation/feature_05_sitrep_display.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Battle Grid</i></summary>
<br>

The battle grid is a graphical representation of a 2D nested list containing the coordinates used in the game. This list will initially hold a default '~' symbol to represent each coordinate. 
<br><br>
As the user progresses through the game, each coordinate will be updated after each shot with either a miss symbol 'X', enemy ship destroyed symbol 'E' or a merchant ship destroyed symbol 'M'.
<br><br>
To note, when either an enemy ship or merchant ship destroyed symbol is displayed, it will not be overwritten with an 'X' symbol if the user chooses to fire upon those same coordinates again.
<br><br>
The battle grid is a 7 x 7 grid by default. A decision was made not to make it variable in size at the time of deployment, this was due to the impact on the positioning of other elements around the battle grid. The ability to allow the user to change the size of the grid has been included as a future feature to be implemented.
<br><br>

![Battle Grid](assets/documentation/feature_06_battle_grid.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Battleship Weapons</i></summary>
<br>

The user's role is to direct and fire the primary weapon of the battleship, in the narrative, this is described as the 'Sea Stiletto' nuclear torpedo. 
<br><br>
To fire the weapon, the coordinates are entered into the input fields when the 'Weapons Ready' alert is displayed, these coordinates are validated and once accepted, they will be registered on the battle grid.
<br><br>

![Battleship Weapons](assets/documentation/feature_07_battleship_weapons.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Enemy Weapons</i></summary>
<br>

Once the user has fired a torpedo, the enemy will then be given an opportunity to return fire. This involved automatically generating a random set of coordinates within the constraints of the battle grid.
<br><br>
The enemy's shot will then be checked against the user's 'hull plate locations' and also the merchant ship locations, either of which will be decremented if the enemy shot is successful.
<br><br>

![Enemy Weapons](assets/documentation/feature_08_enemy_weapons.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Shot Feedback</i></summary>
<br>

After each shot is taken, either by the user's battlehip or the enemy, immediate feedback is provided with a quick animation.
<br><br>
Color is used here to provide a visually interesting feature and enhance the user experience.
<br><br>
A summary of the different shot feedback messages is shown below.
<br><br>

![Shot Feedback](assets/documentation/feature_09_shot_feedback.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Battle Update (Success)</i></summary>
<br>

If the user is able to sink all the enemy ships within the game constraints, a 'Battle Update' will be displayed giving immediate feedback on the mission's success.
<br><br>
This will be accompanied by a narrative giving more details on the outcome.
<br><br>

![Battle Update Success](assets/documentation/feature_10_battle_update_win.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Battle Update (Failed)</i></summary>
<br>

There is only one way to win the game, however, there are several to lose!
<br><br>
If the user's torpedos run out or if the number drops below the number of enemy ships afloat, the mission will fail.
<br><br>
If the user's hull plates run out, the mission will fail.
<br><br>
If the number of merchant ships afloat reaches zero, the mission will fail.
<br><br>
If any of the failure conditions are met, a 'Battle Update' will be displayed to the user providing immediate feedback on the mission failure. This will be accompanied by a narrative giving more details on the outcome.
<br><br>

![Battle Update Failed](assets/documentation/feature_10_battle_update_lose.webp)

<br>

<br>
<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Future Features</b></summary>
<br>
<details>
  <summary> <i>Battleship: Vengeance</i></summary>
<br>
If the user completes the mission in 'Battleship: Rescue' successfully, the narrative leads up to an abrupt change in the direction of the war.
<br><br>
This allows a natural sequel mission to be developed, perhaps in the form of a timed mission where the user has to destroy as many enemy ships as possible, this would have a points scoring system, with different classes of enemy ships having different scores associated with them. Destroying certain types of ships would grant the user extra time.<br><br>Also, at stages during the timed mission, the enemy could call in reinforcements which would appear on the battle grid on coordinates that were previously marked as 'missed shots'.
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Battleship: Infiltrate</i></summary>
<br>
This feature would be another mission, where the user would navigate the battle grid while trying to stay out of the 'radar zone' of enemy ships.<br><br>The enemy ships would be hidden from the user, however, the user would have a certain amount of attempts to deploy an EMP pulse that would disable the enemy's radars and make them visible on the battle grid for a brief amount of time.<br><br>The mission would be successful once the user navigates the battleship to a designated point on the battle grid.
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Skip Text</i></summary>
<br>
The game makes use of a 'typing effect' function (code credited in the 'Reference Materials Used' section). I personally really like the effect, but some users may prefer to have the option to skip the text and make it appear instantly.<br><br>This will be a feature that will be included in a future update.
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>Game Variables</i></summary>
<br>
The game in its current state is very challenging, even at the lowest difficulty level.<br><br>User feedback will be requested to gauge if players are enjoying the game, and what variables may need to be adjusted to provide a more positive playing experience, e.g, grid size, torpedo counts, enemy ships etc. 
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <i>External Libraries</i></summary>
<br>
To improve the user experience, it may be possible to use libraries such as 'Rich' and 'Colorama' to provide a more visually appealing interface.
<br><br>

<tr><th>Banner Art PEP8 Errors</th><th>Status</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>
<br>
When adding the banner art, I encountered several warnings in the Code Institute python linter. I researched online, and one option was to print the banner art in a 'raw' format, however, due to the design of the art, this was not an optimal solution. There are three horizontal lines in the center of the banner art that I needed to use coloured text for, and also, I wanted them to be animated using the typing effect function.

<tr>
<td>

![Banner Art 1](assets/documentation/bug_01_banner_art_a.webp)

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<br>
The eventual solution was to split the banner art into three separate variables and print them individually to the console as needed.

Another validation error that I found tricky initially related to the 2D nested list that would contain the battle grid. It took several attempts to find the right format that would be considered valid by the python linter.

  <summary> <i>Feedback Animation</i></summary>
<br>

<table>
<tr><th>Feedback Animation</th><th>Status</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>
<br>
I initially enountered issues with getting the shot feedback animation to behave as expected, this animation involves printing text to the console, then flushing or overwriting that text using the carriage return escape character. However, I had overlooked this and included a new line escape character which resulted in several lines being printed, instead of just the one line being overwritten. The bug was resolved and behaves as expected in the deployed app.

<tr><th>Shot Recognition</th><th>Status</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>
<br>
I also experienced problems with registering the user and enemy shots on the battle grid. To solve the problem I used the 'type' method to determine what the computer was 'seeing'. This revealed that although the user input looked identical to what was expected, there were two different data types at play.

Once I had this information, I was able to amend the user shot variable and the inputs to create a 'shot' that would match the coordinates in the enemy ship list exactly. This resolved the issue.

## Acknowledgements

I want to acknowledge and thank the Student Support team at Code Institute again for helping me keep the developer dream alive.

I'd also like to thank my mentor Martina Terlevic for the calls during the Python project and the very helpful feedback and suggestions.

And most importantly, I'd like to acknowledge the need for humanity to start working harder at getting along with each other, let's keep the theme of mutually assured destruction confined to the realm of video games! 🙏
