## Introduction
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Features

A summary of the main features of the game is shown below.

<br>
<details>
  <summary><b>Banner Art</b></summary>
<br>

The user is provided with a visually interesting with start screen including ASCII banner art and tag lines giving context to the game.

The ASCII art was generated by [patorjk.com](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20)

<br>

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Input Validation</b></summary>
<br>

Input validation is used throughout the game wherever the user is asked to interact with the program.
These inputs will be checked, and whenever they are invalid, an alert will be displayed emphasising what the requirements are.

<br>

![Input Validation](assets/documentation/feature_02_input_validation.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Difficulty Levels</b></summary>
<br>

The user is able to select from different difficulty levels to play the game. 

Each difficulty level will initialise the game with different starting variables (e.g number of torpedos, enemy ships etc)

<br>

![Difficulty Levels](assets/documentation/feature_03_difficulty_levels.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Narrative</b></summary>
<br>

A narrative has been created for the game, depicting a scenario where the user is in command of the last battleship in a war that is doomed to be lost unless the user can protect several merchant ships that are rushing to deliver cargo that will turn the tide of events.
<br>
<br>
The narrative also subtly introduces the game mechanics to the user, and attempts to provide immersion for the user, which in turn will provide a more enjoyable user experience.
<br><br>
It should be noted, that although the narrative is completely fictional and cursory in nature, it tries to pack a punch in the few lines available. As it depicts scenarios of warfare, it may not be suitable for all audiences. As such. the game is aimed at adults instead of a younger audience.
<br><br>

![Narrative](assets/documentation/feature_04_narrative.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>SITREP Display</b></summary>
<br>

The SITREP display, or 'situation report', is the main source of information displayed to the user during the game. An overview of the different fields is shown below.
<br><br>
<b>Torpedos remaining</b>: The current number of torpedos available to the user, if this is less than the enemy ships remaining, the game mission will fail.
<br><br>
<b>Hull plates remaining</b>: The current number of hull plates on the user's battleship, this is decremented with each enemy hit. If it reaches zero, the mission will fail.
<br><br>
<b>Enemy ships remaining</b>: The current number of enemy ships afloat. This is decremented with each successful user hit. If it reaches zero, the mission will succeed.
<br><br>
<b>Merchant ships remaining</b>: The current number of merchant ships afloat. This is decremented with each accidental user hit, and successful enemy hit. If it reaches zero, the mission will fail.
<br><br>
<b>Missed shots</b>: The current number of shots missed by the user.
<br><br>
<b>Shot accuracy</b>: This is a current statistic of the user's accuracy (enemy ships destroyed / total user shots, expressed as a percentage).
<br><br>
<b>Enemy ships destroyed</b>: The current number of enemy ships destroyed by the user.
<br><br>
<b>Merchant ships destroyed</b>: The current number of merchant ships destroyed, by both the user and the enemy (computer).
<br><br>

![SITREP Display](assets/documentation/feature_05_sitrep_display.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Battle Grid</b></summary>
<br>

The battle grid is a graphical representation of a 2D nested list containing the coordinates used in the game. This list will initially hold a default '~' symbol to represent each coordinate. 
<br><br>
As the user progresses through the game, each coordinate will be updated after each shot with either a miss symbol 'X', enemy ship destroyed symbol 'E' or a merchant ship destroyed symbol 'M'.
<br><br>
To note, when either an enemy ship or merchant ship destroyed symbol is displayed, it will not be overwritten with an 'X' symbol if the user chooses to fire upon those same coordinates again.
<br><br>
The battle grid is a 7 x 7 grid by default. A decision was made not to make it variable in sise at the time of deployment, this was due to the impact on the positioning of other elements around the battle grid. The ability to allow the user to change the size of the grid has been included as a future feature to be implemented.
<br><br>

![Battle Grid](assets/documentation/feature_06_battle_grid.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Battleship Weapons</b></summary>
<br>

The user's role is to direct and fire the primary weapon of the battleship, in the narrative, this is described as the 'Sea Stiletto' nuclear torpedo. 
<br><br>
To fire the weapon, the coordinates are entered into the input fields when the 'Weapons Ready' alert is displayed, these coordinates are validated and once accepted, they will be registered on the battle grid.
<br><br>

![Battleship Weapons](assets/documentation/feature_07_battleship_weapons.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Enemy Weapons</b></summary>
<br>

Once the user has fired a torpedo, the enemy will then be given an opportunity to return fire. This involved automatically generating a random set of coordinates within the constraints of the battle grid.
<br><br>
The enemy's shot will then be checked against the user's 'hull plate locations' and also the merchant ship locations, either of which will be decremented if the enemy shot is successful.
<br><br>

![Enemy Weapons](assets/documentation/feature_08_enemy_weapons.webp)

<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Shot Feedback</b></summary>
<br>

After each shot is taken, either by the user's battlehip or the enemy, immediate feedback is provided with a quick animation.
<br><br>
Color is used here to provide a visually interesting feature and enhance the user experience.
<br><br>
A summary of the different shot feedback messages is shown below.
